# Time Series Forecasting Project

This repository contains code for a time series forecasting project using Python and the Facebook Prophet library. The project aims to forecast energy consumption patterns based on historical data.

## Project Overview

The project follows a step-by-step process, including:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: 
   - Load the historical energy consumption data.
   - Handle missing values, if any, and preprocess the data.

2. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Use the Prophet library for time series forecasting.
   - Train the Prophet model on the preprocessed data.

3. **Validation and Evaluation**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

4. **Visualization and Interpretation**:
   - Visualize the original data, forecasts, trends, and seasonality components.
   - Interpret the forecasting results and draw insights from the visualizations.

## Getting Started

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the project interactively)
- Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, fbprophet, scikit-learn
